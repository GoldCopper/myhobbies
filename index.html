 <p>My hobby is playig the cello! I enjoy playing the cello, it is a fun hobby of mine! I have been playing the cello for over two years. I enjoy it and have a lot of fun playing it. I have gotten very good and I am going to a cello camp this summer. Hopefully it doesn't get canceled. I love performing for other people but sometimes it is scary.</p>
